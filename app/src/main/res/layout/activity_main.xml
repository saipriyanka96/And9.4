    <!--RelativeLayout is a view group that displays child views in relative positions.
          ListView is a view which groups several items and display them in vertical scrollable list.
           The list items are automatically inserted to the list using an Adapter that pulls content from a source such as an array
            or database.
           ID-Any View object may have an integer ID associated with it, to uniquely identify the View within the tree.
          When the application is compiled, this ID is referenced as an integer, but the ID is typically assigned in the layout XML file
          as a string, in the id attribute.This is an XML attribute common to all View objects (defined by the View class) and you will use
          it very often
          wrap_content tells your view to size itself to the dimensions required by its content.
          match_parent tells your view to become as big as its parent view group will allow.
